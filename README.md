Sagacity - Sentiment Analyzer
=============================

Delta TFIDF weighed,SVM based text sentiment analyzer

Detailed explanation of Sagacity - https://github.com/npramod05/sagacity/wiki/Description-of-What-is-behind-Sagacity.

Back-End: Consists of pipelines/stages namely Mongo
Seed,PrePorcessing(Includes generation of Delta-TFIDF),Training, Bulk
Prediction

Front-End: Rails application which uses the trained model generated by
the back-end and provides a simple front end to analyze input text and
generate relevant sentiment.

To train:
->Feed tweets/sentences using a file(one per line), see back-end mongo seed test for example.
Default the MongoSeed spec seeds from /data/training/positive*.txt for positively labelled sentences/tweets and
/data/training/negative*.txt for negatively labelled sentences
->Run the preprocessing pipeline, see back-end preprocessing test for example.
->Run run the training pipeline, see training test for example
The front end is now ready and can generate sentiments for new sentences.

**More Specs will be updated soon.

Future Enhancement:
===================

NLP techniques and possible n-grams as part of feature space enhancements

Changes in cleansing and pre-processing

Multi Threading for preprocessing and all the back-end tasks
